contributing
============

1. First you fork the repository into your account (forking makes another copy)
2. clone it 
3. When you commit, original file will not be affected


git settings
============

$ git config user.email "ba_aptech@hotmail.com"
$ git config user.name "bilalaptech"
add global flag for global settings

$ git config --global user.email "ba_aptech@hotmail.com"
$ git config --global user.name "bilalaptech"


this is odd
