=============Notes next version ====================

Difference between svn & git is that svn is central repository system and git is distributed, git has local copy too, but svn don't

Difference between Git hub and git
Git HUb is a central repository system (it's kind of social network for developers). Git on the other hand is a local repository tool, which allows to pull and push from and to Git hub

case : A repository exists, you are linking it with local repo
1. git init
2. git remote add origin "http://...."
3. git pull origin master
